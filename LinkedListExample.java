// nodes are present in link list  not like array
// it is flexible list 
// not circular so end and start don't share addresses.
//node have address of forward and backward node.
//Every node have two pointers .
//if u use kinkedlist API no need for this pointer management.
//not adjecent memory location this is stored so it is flexible to add inbetween and retrieve too but not efficient (not fast)
//last node pointing to null (not circular)---->>Only doubly linkedlist.

//kangarroo iterator  [ *baseadress+(size*index)  in C++  ArrayList efficient but not flexible
//turtle Iterator in linked list
// linkedlist management is in phone contacts where there is view which is sorted but the location of contacts are different 
//Arraylist like phone call logs
// hashset used to store huge amount of unique data in efficiently
// recurssive is use in tree set which is not efficient
